# 🏥 Hospital Management System — MySQL Project

This project showcases a comprehensive Hospital Management Database System designed using MySQL, focusing on efficient data modeling, relational integrity, and real-world operational use cases.

It is structured to reflect best practices in database schema design, data importation, and analytical querying, making it an ideal addition to a professional portfolio for roles in data engineering, backend development, or database administration.

## 📁 Project Structure

| Component              | Description                                                                                           |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CREATE DATABASE`      | Initializes the `Hospital` database and its relational structure                                      |
| `TABLE DEFINITIONS`    | Logical data modeling across core entities: Patients, Doctors, Appointments, Medical Records, Billing |
| `DATA IMPORT`          | CSV data ingestion using `LOAD DATA INFILE` with proper handling of nulls, delimiters, and headers    |
| `SQL QUERIES`          | Set of 20+ optimized SQL queries for insights, scheduling logic, and reporting                        |

## 🧱 Database Schema Overview

### 1. `patients`
Stores patient information including demographics and contact details.

### 2. `doctors`
Holds doctor profiles, specializations, and availability information.

### 3. `appointments`
Captures patient-doctor interactions with appointment type, timing, and status.

### 4. `medicalrecords`
Records diagnoses, prescriptions, and treatment plans.

### 5. `billing`
Manages invoices and tracks payment status per appointment.

> All tables follow **normalized design principles**, with primary keys, foreign key constraints (`ON DELETE CASCADE`), and relevant integrity checks.

## 📥 Data Loading

Data is imported from local CSV files using two methods:

- `LOAD DATA INFILE` for scripted bulk loading
- MySQL Workbench's **"Import Data"** option (right-click on table → Table Data Import Wizard) for manual uploads

| Table          | CSV Filename      | Method Used         | Notes                                             |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `patients`     | `PatientID.csv`   | LOAD DATA INFILE    | Includes contact and demographic details          |
| `doctors`      | `DoctorID.csv`    | Import Data (GUI)   | Includes specialization and availability          |
| `appointments` | `Hospital.csv`    | LOAD DATA INFILE    | Appointment metadata and scheduling               |
| `billing`      | `Billing.csv`     | Import Data (GUI)   | Amount, payment date, and payment status fields   |

⚠️ **Note for `LOAD DATA INFILE`:** Ensure the files are located in the directory allowed by MySQL’s `secure_file_priv` configuration, typically:
`C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/`
